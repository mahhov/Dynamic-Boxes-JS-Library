Javascript helper library built from scratch that make it easy to quickly create simple and ui with just a few lines of code.   
  
Usage  
Simply add something like addDynBox(new DynBoxData(x, y, width, height, minwidth, minheight, maxwidth, maxheight, _name_)) to your body.onload function in your html.  
Then add something like var _name_ = <whatever you want the contents of the box to be>  
And now you have a box with your desired contents on your html site, that's moveable and resizable (drag on the edges and corners).  
Right clicking a box on the site will order it to the back.
